### These are miscilaneous settings needed for the laser locking program. They are:
### the time between checks of the etalons in seconds, the numbre of data scans to 
### keep and plot, whether to check the lasers or not (1 = yes and 0 = no) even if
### they should not be locked, and whether the program is running in software testing
### mode or as standard (this option is currently not set up), what type of switch
### to use for the wavemeter (see TypeDef_WavemeterSwitchType.ctl for details), and
### the time between scan steps in seconds.

### The type of laser that is being used. This corresponds to the typedefintion 
### TypeDef_LaserTypes.ctl

### The exact desired wavelengths of the lasers in nanometers
Wavelength;;
828.19100;828.29015;828.29365;;

### The exact tolerance allowed for locking...how far off can the lasers be before 
### the locking program attempts to lock them...in nanometers

### The desired starting temperature of the lasers, in degrees celcius
Temperature;;
30.082;32.323;25;;

### The current that the diode controller should use, in milliamps
Current;;

### This is currently not being used but these should be the proportional gain constants
### for each laser to do locking via PID control
P Gain;;

### This is the maximum allowable time that a laser is allowed to try to lock itself 
### before it times out, in seconds.

### This is a boolean operator to set whether the lasers should try to lock themselves
### or just simply check their status (1 = yes lock and 0 = just check)
Locking On;;

### This is a boolean operator to set whether the lasers should try to lock themselves 
### usin ga single step or PID control method (1 = single step and 0 = PID)

### This is the current and only locking method for locking the laser. This is the 
### temperature step size to take when trying to temperature tune the lasers in 
### degrees celciuc
Lock Step Size;;
0.001;0.001;0.001;;

### This is the minimum power required to be read from teh wavemeter to perform laser
### locking. This value is compared to the value read by the wavemeter. The units will
### be dBm
Min Locking Power;;
-15;-15;-15;;

### This is an array describing how the lasers should try to lock themselves. These 
### numbers correspond to the array location of each laser. The scan: 0;1;2;; would check 
### each of the 3 lasers once before returning to the original. The scan: 0;0;0;0;1;; 
### would check the first laser 4 times before checking the other. 
Scan Strategy;;

### The type of etalonthat is being used. This corresponds to the typedefintion 
### TypeDef_EtalonTypes.ctl
Etalon Types;;
