### This is the communication protocol to use for the weather station.
### RS485 to USB = 0, RS485 to Ethernet = 1

### These are miscilaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the weather station. These are currently: the update period of the weather 
### station in seconds, the time to wait between write and read of the comm port,
### The number of measurments to save, and the number of weather station variables
### to keep.

### This is currently unused but was intended to be used as the starting point to
