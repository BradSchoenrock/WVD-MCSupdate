This file is used to define the initial state of the humidity sensor in the Water Vapor DIAL Main labview program. 

### This is where the Labview code should find the humidity sensor.
IP Address;;
192.168.0.170; 161; 750; -1; -1;;

### These are miscilaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the humidity sensor. These are currently: the update period of the humidity
### sensorin seconds, the number of measurments to save, and the number of humidity 
### sensor variables to keep. 
Child Variables;;
4;4500;4;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions.
FilePaths;;
.\Data\HumiditySensor\;
Humidity;
HumLogging;
.\ContainerResources.llb\Log_SetUserComment.vi;
.\ContainerResources.llb\Idle_Password.vi;;

### This is currently unused but was intended to be used as the starting point to 
### set the initial state of the plot bounds. It is likely not necessary if
### we keep autoscaling the plots.
Plot Bounds;;
1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;;
