This file is used to define the initial state of the NetCDF writer in the Water Vapor DIAL Main labview program.
Note that some settings can be for operations or for the receiver scans. Both are loaded and one is selected based
on the desired setup from the user. 

### IP address of quantum composer, and port number

### mode. The second is slow update time and is how often to check the complete
### Quantum Composer state.
