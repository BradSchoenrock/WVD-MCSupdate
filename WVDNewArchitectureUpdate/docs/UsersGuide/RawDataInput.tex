Steps of unpacking a single day of data:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Loop over hourly folders (I prefer to dump all data into a single daily directory but that is a convenience not a necessity)}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Loop over hourly file types (more that one of each type can be written if the labview is started more than once in a single hour or restarted)}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item{Check if particular file contains data (by checking for zero-valued dimensions)}
				\item{Loading raw photon count data}
				\item{Loading laser housekeeping data}
				\item{Loading weather station data}
				\item{Loading the operational parameters of the system and time stamps for each file type}
			\end{enumerate}
		\item{Interpolate slower data to highest cadence data (likely housekeeping and weather station data to photon count time grid)}
		\item{Collect all data into a single daily file with a single time dimension}
		\item{Fill in missing data in time (if any time gaps exist) with nan values}
		\item{Combine laser locking, receiver temperature, and all other data flags and create a single quality control flag: (Use Data, Data Warning, or Don't Use)}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
